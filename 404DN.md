The concept behind ERC404 aimed to establish a unified contract serving both as a fungible (FT) and non-fungible token (NFT). However, blending these functionalities within a single contract posed risks of vulnerabilities and non-compliance with established standards. To navigate these challenges, our solution incorporates two distinct contracts: a primary ERC20 contract and a corresponding ERC721 contract. The ERC20 contract functions as a standard token, managing user balances and facilitating the minting and burning of NFTs, which are represented as fractional ownerships of these NFTs, ensuring seamless integration with decentralized exchanges (DEXes).

Ownership of a minimum quantity of ERC20 tokens (equivalent to one base unit or 10^18 tokens) triggers the automatic minting of a corresponding NFT for the holder. Conversely, should their balance fall below this threshold, their most recently minted NFT is destroyed, echoing the principles of ERC404.

The secondary, or "mirror," ERC721 contract behaves like any conventional NFT token, adhering to all ERC721 standards and is compatible with all supporting protocols. This automated process of minting and burning NFTs aligns with the transfer activities of the ERC20 tokens.

The objective of DN404 was to forge a token standard that integrates the fractional ownership feature directly into NFTs, facilitating segment trading without intermediaries. This breakthrough aims to enhance liquidity for NFT projects by enabling their fractional trade on both NFT marketplaces and DEXes, a novel feature distinct from the functionalities offered by ERC1155 tokens.

This innovation benefits from the optimization skills of @optimizoor, the mind behind Solady and ERC721A, although it's important to note that the code is yet to undergo formal auditing. As such, users should proceed with caution, acknowledging that the use of this code carries inherent risks. The development team disclaims liability for any potential vulnerabilities or issues that may emerge, advising a prudent approach to its deployment.
